# Project Overview
You can easily train Flux models using Gradio through Docker. We focus solely on Flux models and aim to support training for all Flux-related models (full fine-tuning, LORA).

## Features
1. LORA training
2. Full fine-tuning
3. Face data cropping preprocessing for portrait model training
4. Data preprocessing functionality
5. Inference functionality for trained models
